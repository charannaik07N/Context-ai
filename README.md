## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Groq API key

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srivardhan04/Contexta-AI.git
cd Contexta-AI




2. Navigate to project directory and create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
````

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create environment configuration file (.env):

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
echo GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here > .env
```

Note: Obtain your Groq API key from https://console.groq.com

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

---

## Running the Application

### Start Backend Server

From project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

The FastAPI server will start on http://localhost:8000

### API Endpoints

- **POST** /upload-paper: Upload PDF document for processing
- **POST** /ask-question: Ask questions about uploaded document
- **GET** /health: Health check endpoint

### Start Frontend Application

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## Usage Guide

1. Open the application in your browser (http://localhost:5173)
2. Upload a research paper in PDF format using the upload panel
3. Wait for document processing and embedding generation
4. Ask questions about the paper content
5. Receive AI-generated answers with source references
6. Use features like one-line summary, insights, and term definitions

---

## API Configuration

The application requires a Groq API key for LLM functionality:

1. Sign up at https://console.groq.com
2. Generate an API key
3. Add to .env file: GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
4. Restart the backend server

---

## Important Notes

- Keep .env file secure and never commit to version control
- FAISS vector store is saved locally for persistence
- Document embeddings are cached for faster retrieval
- Text-to-speech requires system audio output
- Supports PDF files up to 50MB in size

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No PDF has been processed yet" error**

- Ensure a PDF file has been successfully uploaded and processed
- Check vector_store directory exists and contains FAISS files

**CORS errors from frontend**

- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:8000
- Check CORS configuration in main.py matches frontend origin

**PDF upload fails**

- Ensure file is valid PDF format
- Check uploaded_docs directory has write permissions
- Verify file size is under 50MB

**API key errors**

- Confirm GROQ_API_KEY is set in .env file
- Verify API key is valid and has active quota
- Restart backend after changing .env file

---

## Project Roadmap

- Multi-document analysis and comparisons
- Advanced search filters and sorting
- Custom prompt templates
- Document annotation features
- Export summary to PDF
- Collaborative sharing features
- API rate limiting and user authentication
- Support for multiple document formats
